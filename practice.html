  International trucks have been built and sold by the International Harvester Company (renamed Navistar International in 1986) from 1909 until the present (2024). Originally marketed to farmers the trucks were immediately successful and were sold to businesses in cities as well. Since then International trucks have been sold worldwide and built or assembled in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, Germany, Mexico, South Africa, the Soviet Union, and Turkey.
